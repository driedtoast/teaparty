h1. Overview

The following project is to manage a cloud based infrastructure for multiple providers. The intent is to grow the project into a general administration tool.

The project's layout is as follows:
* config/ - directory containing the configuration for the application
* teaparty/ - application files and scripts
* teaparty/startup - startup scripts
* static/ - images, css, etc...
* teaparty/templates - template files for the screens
* teapartysvr - startup and server script
* setup.sh - handy script to install django and boto

It relies on the following projects:

* Django - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#installing-official-release
** Used for the web framework
* Boto - http://boto.googlecode.com/files/boto-1.9b.tar.gz
** Used for interacting with amazon aws services
h2. Installing

Setup the following directory, this will be done in the startup script:
* /opt/teaparty - used to store the db
* cd teaparty
* python manage.py syncdb

h2. Starting server

To start the server do the following:
* cd teaparty
* python manage.py runserver

This will move to teapartysvr start instead.
