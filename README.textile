h1. Overview

The following project is to manage a cloud based infrastructure for multiple providers. The intent is to grow the project into a general administration tool.

The project's layout is as follows:
* config/ - directory containing the configuration for the application
* teaparty/ - application files and scripts
* teaparty/startup - startup scripts
* static/ - images, css, etc...
* data/ - database directory for sqllite
* teaparty/templates - template files for the screens
* teapartysvr - startup and server script
* setup.sh - handy script to install django and boto

It relies on the following projects:

* Django - http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#installing-official-release
** Used for the web framework
* Boto - http://boto.googlecode.com/files/boto-1.9b.tar.gz
** Used for interacting with amazon aws services

You can install the above with the setup.sh script.

h2. Installing

Untar, assuming this will result in a tar
Or git clone

Update any configuration under config/general.config

That's it your are up and running

h2. Starting server

This starts up the server and does some initialization of db on first start.

h2. Initializing data

Also setup the properties to properly configure the files
